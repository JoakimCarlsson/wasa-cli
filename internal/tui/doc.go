// Package tui is the wasa cockpit: a Bubble Tea terminal UI that shows one tab
// per workspace (ordered most-recently-used), the sessions of the active
// workspace each with a running/exited status dot, and the create, attach and
// kill actions over them. It does not reimplement orchestration; it drives the
// registry (#20), profiles (#21) and the launch seam (worktree → hook → tmux)
// and reads session status from the reconciled registry rather than polling
// agent output.
//
// Attach is the one sharp edge: it hands the terminal to tmux through
// tea.ExecProcess, never a hand-wired exec.Command, so Bubble Tea suspends its
// renderer for the attach and resumes cleanly on detach (C-b d). See attach.
